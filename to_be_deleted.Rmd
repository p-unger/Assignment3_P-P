## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
ggplot(male_educ, aes(x=factor(age), y=vhappy1)) + stat_summary(fun.y="mean", geom="point", col="Navyblue") + expand_limits(y=c(0.25,0.6))               
```
